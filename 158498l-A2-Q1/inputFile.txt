Tigers are some of the most amazing creatures on the planet, 
they are the largest members of the cat family and are renowned 
for their power and strength. As the largest member of the cat 
family, Tigers are strong, powerful and one of nature's most 
feared predators. Their beautiful orange and black striped coats 
provide camouflage when hunting prey at night, when they can 
reach speeds of 65 km/hr (~40 mph).Tigers are the most varied 
cat on earth, and have many unique features and interesting 
characteristics. They are magnificent creatures which are sadly 
endangered due to human carelessness. But, hopefully if we learn 
a little about them, we can become more aware of this admirable 
animal and help them grow in numbers once again.
